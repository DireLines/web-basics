            I went to Miller’s with my friends on February 13 to see the John D’earth Trio perform. It was an unseasonably warm night, but still chilly. The smell of tobacco smoke greeted us at the entrance, but in the interior of Miller’s it was either absent or masked by the strongly perfumed air. The show was supposed to start at 10:30 pm, so we arrived fashionably late at 10:50, only to discover that the musicians were not there (save the pianist, who was performing calm improvisation to pass the time). After walking the mall for a few more minutes, we grabbed a table upstairs to sip drinks and wait for the music. I sipped a Moscow mule and we split a plate of wings.

And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
   Hark, hark!

      Bow, wow.
Hark, hark! I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow

            At around 11:15, jazz started up downstairs. I think the first tune played was a straight-ahead piece which showcased the soloists one by one. Charles Owens, the only one I knew beforehand, played tenor sax. Besides him, there was a trumpeter, a stand-up bassist, a drummer and a pianist. John D’earth himself never turned up -  the trumpeter was somebody looking to be a few years younger than Charles Owens. Other tunes included some bossa, some 12-bar blues, and some bebop at the kind of fast tempo I like the most. The people at the bar and the tables downstairs did not watch the musicians save some occasional glances, but I could tell they were appreciative of the atmosphere. After all, that’s what Miller’s has over the other bars in town.

            Live jazz fills a room in a way that doesn’t come across in most of the recordings we listen to in class. With older recording technology, much of the low end is lost and the sound loses some fullness. In newer jazz recordings, the instruments are often individually mic’d and the sound becomes less like the original acoustic environment in which the sound of jazz developed. I was appreciative of the fact that Miller’s used mics sparingly to boost the volume of the soloists just enough to match the drums.

           My friends and I had finished eating and drinking. I don’t normally go to bars, so I was surprised that the Moscow mule cost $8.00. We walked down to watch the musicians for a little while and stood in the shadow of the stairs, squeezing up against them to let waiters past. Charles Owens was taking a quite technical solo over a bebop tune. He has a mastery of a particular technique where he plays dense clusters of notes in quick succession and the pattern slowly wanders up or down the sax’s range. The most impressive moments of the solo were things like that. He also solos well in the more standard melodic style of bebop.

            My overall impression was that if I were the type of person to go to bars, Miller’s would be my choice. I am a musician myself, and often in other restaurants I find myself distracted by the background music. It would be a nice change of pace to have music closer to the foreground.
